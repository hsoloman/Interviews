The major difference between threads and processes is:

    Threads share the address space of the process that created it; processes have their own address space.
    Threads have direct access to the data segment of its process; processes have their own copy of the data segment of the parent process.
    Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process; processes must use interprocess communication to communicate with sibling processes.
    Threads have almost no overhead; processes have considerable overhead.
    New threads are easily created; new processes require duplication of the parent process.
    Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process; processes can only exercise control over child processes.
    Changes to the main thread (cancellation, priority change, etc.) may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process; changes to the parent process does not affect child processes.
